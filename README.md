# Chicken! Probability
Probability calculator for the dice game named "Chicken!" (see [here](https://keymastergames.com/products/chicken?variant=39965853515834))

See spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FwQF9nV0qX2o5Tyn5zU2RqOSdHQPEhr6LgFket5ygiE/edit?usp=sharing). I started with this, then wrote this program to verify my math.

LaTeX document explaining the formula WIP.
